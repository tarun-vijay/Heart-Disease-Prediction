# Heart-Disease-Prediction

This project involves developing a heart disease prediction system using machine learning techniques. We applied various algorithms like logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and support vector machines (SVM) for classification and evaluated them to find the highest accuracy. The model's performance is assessed using accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and ROC curves. This system aims to aid healthcare professionals in early detection and diagnosis of heart disease, improving patient outcomes.


The tools used in this project include:

1. Python : The main programming language used for data analysis and model development.
2. Pandas : For data manipulation and analysis.
3. NumPy: For numerical computations.
4. Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and support vector machines (SVM).
5. Matplotlib: For data visualization, including confusion matrices and ROC curves.
6. Seaborn: For enhanced data visualization and plotting.

These tools collectively facilitate data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization to build an effective heart disease prediction system.
